# NQOISC (not quite one instruction set computer)
This repository contains the source code for the NQOISC basic toolchain.

## The NQOISC Instruction Set
The insruction set is based on [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
Each instruction is 32-bit. The 30-bit immediate is sign extended to 32-bit.
It is byte addressed. Big endian. It is assumed that the program counter and
the data pointer are initialized to zero. The program counter points to the next
instruction to be executed.

instruction format:<br>
```
Opcode  Imm 30-bit
00      000000000000000000000000000000

| Opcode |  Name       |  Description                                                                      |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00     |  right imm  |  Move the data pointer to the right by imm bytes.                                 |
| 01     |  add   imm  |  Add imm to the current address pointed to by the data pointer.                   |
| 10     |  bnz   imm  |  Set the program counter to program counter + imm if the current address pointed to by the data pointer is equal to zero. |

Any I/O is memory mapped.
